Especially if we don't have perfect knowledge of how many _true_ states there are?\n\nFrom [Matt Johnson's thesis](https://people.csail.mit.edu/mattjj/thesis/ch3.pdf), I learned exactly how.\n\nSome of us might be used to thinking about transition matrices that have strong diagonals.\nThat's all good for providing _stability_ in a sequence of transitions.\nBut if the goal is to provide a model\nwhere the constrained set of states is given priority over the other states,\nthen what we _really_ need is a transition matrix where the first K _columns_ of the transition matrix\nare given priority over the others.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n%load_ext autoreload\n%autoreload 2\n%matplotlib inline\n%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'\n%load_ext watermark\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfrom jax import random, vmap, jit, grad, lax\nfrom jax.scipy import stats\nimport jax.numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom functools import partial\nimport seaborn as sns\n```\n:::\n\n\nTo generate a transition matrix with this desired property,\nwe can turn to the [GEM distribution][gem].\nThe GEM distribution is one way to generate a random vector\nfrom a Dirichlet distribution\n(which is the generalization of a Beta distribution).\n\nYou can think of it as stick-breaking, basically.\nWe take a stick of unit length 1,\nand break it in two according to a draw from a Beta distribution.\nWe record the length of the left part of the stick,\nand then break the right stick into two according to a draw from a Beta distribution.\nWe then record the new length of the left side and break the right one again and again,\n_ad infinitum_ or until we have reached a predefined (but finite) number of breaks.\nThe vector of recorded lengths becomes a \"weighting\" vector.\nOne thing to keep in mind: this weighting vector doesn't necessarily sum to 1,\nso in order to use the weighting vector in a transition matrix,\nwe do have to normalize it to sum to 1,\nor we append the remainder of the stick to the end to get it to sum to 1.\n\nEnough said, let's dig in and try simulating this process.\n\nFirstly, we generate a vector of i.i.d. draws from a Beta distribution with parameters $\\alpha = 1$ and $\\beta = 1$.\n\n[gem]: https://towardsdatascience.com/behind-the-models-beta-dirichlet-and-gem-distributions-526b11a24359\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nkey = random.PRNGKey(45)  # for reproducibility\nbeta_draws = random.beta(key, a=1, b=1, shape=(10,))\nplt.plot(beta_draws, marker=\"o\")\nsns.despine()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](generating-markov-chains-dirichlet_files/figure-html/cell-4-output-1.png){width=571 height=411}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow, we take this and begin our stick-breaking process.

Thus, `b` acts as a \"concentration\" parameter. Smaller values means probability mass is concentrated on a smaller number of slots, while larger values means probability mass is diffused across a larger number of slots.\n\nHow does this relate to transition matrices in hidden Markov models? Well, a potentially desirable property is that we wish to express is that most of the states tend to move into a certain smaller number of states, thereby _concentrating_ the number of occupied states into a smaller set. This is equivalent to concentrating the transition matrix to a subset of _columns_. Let's see how we can generate this kind of transition matrix.\n\nFirstly, since transition matrices are square, let's start with a 15x15 transition matrix, i.e. one with 15 states.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=7}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nN_STATES = 15\nCONCENTRATION = 2\n\nbeta_draws = random.beta(key, a=1, b=CONCENTRATION, shape=(N_STATES, N_STATES))\n```\n:::\n\n\nTo visualize these i.i.d.

In other words, we have not yet generated matrices that allow for _stability inside a state_. Stability inside a state is generated from strong diagonals. We can engineer this in the generation of the matrix by leveraging (once again) the Beta distribution. Specifically, the generative story here is that each row of the transition matrix is generated by stick-breaking, but the diagonals are replaced by a Beta draw that is biased towards high probabilities.

We also define the gradient of the loss function.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=33}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndef loglike_loss(log_concentration, transition_matrix):\n    concentration = np.exp(log_concentration)\n    ll = transition_matrix_logpdf(transition_matrix, concentration)\n    return -ll\n\nloglike_loss = jit(loglike_loss)\ndloglike_loss = grad(loglike_loss)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNext up, we do the loop. Instead of writing an explicit for-loop, we are going to some JAX trickery here:\n\n1. We write the loop taking advantage of `lax.scan`, which allows us to leverage the previous state to get back parameters to optimize.\n1. We also vmap our training loop over all 5 matrices, starting with the same log concentration starting point. This allows us to essentially train five models at one shot. (I could have `pmap`-ed it, but I really only have one CPU and one GPU on my computer.)\n1. Since the result is a vmapped, we have a collection of final states and historical states (which we can post-process post-hoc). Hence, we can vmap `get_params` over final states to get back the vector of final states (from a constant initial state).\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=34}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfrom jax.example_libraries.optimizers import adam\n\ninit, update, get_params = adam(0.05)\nlog_conc_start = random.normal(key)\n\ndef step(prev_state, i, data, dloss):\n    \"\"\"One step in the training loop.\"\"\"\n    params = get_params(prev_state)\n    g = dloss(params, data)\n    state = update(i, g, prev_state)\n    return state, state\n\ndef train(transition_matrix, dloss, params, n_steps=200):\n    \"\"\"The training loop for one transition matrix.\"\"\"\n    stepfunc = partial(step, data=transition_matrix, dloss=dloss)\n    stepfunc = jit(stepfunc)\n\n    state = init(params)\n    final_state, states = lax.scan(stepfunc, state, np.arange(n_steps))\n    return final_state, states\n\ntrainfunc = partial(train, params=log_conc_start, dloss=dloglike_loss)\ntrainfunc = jit(trainfunc)\n# Train across all transition matrices!\nfinal_states, states_history = vmap(trainfunc)(transition_matrices)\nnp.exp(vmap(get_params)(final_states))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=34}\n```\nArray([ 0.9300743,  3.155341 ,  5.2777195, 10.022282 , 16.264479 ],      dtype=float32)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can also get the history by `vmap`-ing `get_params` over `all_states`.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=35}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nlog_concentration_history = vmap(get_params)(states_history)\n\nfor concentration, history in zip(CONCENTRATIONS, log_concentration_history):\n    plt.plot(np.exp(history), label=concentration)\nplt.xlabel(\"Iteration\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Concentration Value\")\nplt.legend()\nsns.despine()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](generating-markov-chains-dirichlet_files/figure-html/cell-36-output-1.png){width=597 height=429}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow, if you're wondering how I knew 200 steps would be sufficient for convergence _a priori_, I didn't :). I had originally tried 1000 steps before staring at the concentration curves, at which point I then knew 200 was sufficient. So... no magic there.\n\n## Summary\n\nThis was a bit of a whirlwind tour of a notebook, in that there were many concepts and ideas tied together into one \"project\".\n\nWith respect to HMMs, it's super important to have a proper mental model of each of its components. In the case of _expressing_ the idea that we have a restricted number of states, we may _engineer_ this into the model by taking advantage of column-wise heaviness in a restricted subset of states. This is mathematically most naturally incorporated by composint together row-wise Dirichlet-distributed probability arrays. We can also mathematically _engineer_ consistency in states by taking advantage of high Beta-distributed values. Compose the two together, and we get a transition matrix that favours entry into a small number of states with stability in there.\n\nBeyond that lesson, we saw the power of composable programs using JAX. `vmap`, `jit`, `lax.scan`, and more from the JAX toolkit gives us the ability to write performant programs that sort of \"just make sense\", once you know what their idioms are. Specifically:\n\n- `vmap` is a vanilla for-loop, processing an elementary function over an axis of an array.\n- `lax.scan` is a carry-over for-loop, processing the result of a previous iteration, with accumulation of history as well.\n- `jit` gives you just-in-time compilation of a function.\n- `grad` gives you gradients of any arbitrary function written in a JAX-compatible, pure functional fashion.\n\nIn particular, getting used to the `lax.scan` idioms has been a literal door-opener. We can now write really performant loops that use results from previous iterations, such as a gradient descent training loop or an MCMC sampler. Using `lax.scan`, we wrote:\n\n- A Markov chain state generator\n- A generator of Dirichlet-distributed weights from i.i.d. Beta distribution draws\n- A reverse generator/estimator of Beta distribution draws from Dirichlet-distributed weights (with some inaccuracies of course, due to a lack of information).\n- A fully-compiled gradient descent training loop that ran extremely fast.\n\nAnd using `vmap`, we were able to do all sorts of vanilla loops, but the one I want to highlight is our ability to `vmap` the compiled training loop across multiple transition matrices. The fact that this _actually_ works never has left me in awe. Props to the JAX team here! Opens the door to `vmap`-ing training loops across random starting points (i.e. a split PRNGKey, much like what we did in the HMM state generator).\n\nThe trade-off is that we don't get nice progress bars, of course, which require that we break out of the compiled loop to show the current state. But the compilation speedups provided the opportunity to build our compiled tensor program end-to-end. We could verify first that things ran correctly on a moderately-sized number of iterations, before finally estimating how long we would need to go until convergence and letting the program run on its own. I'm sure this little change isn't too hard to adapt to, but will give you access to a whole new world of differential tensor programming that is just _cool_!\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=36}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n%watermark\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nLast updated: 2022-12-20T10:43:01.610330-05:00\n\nPython implementation: CPython\nPython version       : 3.10.8\nIPython version      : 8.7.0\n\nCompiler    : GCC 10.4.0\nOS          : Linux\nRelease     : 5.15.0-53-generic\nMachine     : x86_64\nProcessor   : x86_64\nCPU cores   : 8\nArchitecture: 64bit\n\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=37}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n%watermark --iversions\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nmatplotlib: 3.6.2\njax       : 0.4.1\nseaborn   : 0.12.1\n\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n",
