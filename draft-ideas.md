## Computing

### Practical selection of appropriate data structures

Basically covering
where and when to use:

- lists: sequences of identically-typed objects
- dictionaries: simple mappings from hashable type to arbitrary objects
- (named) tuples: more complex mappings
- objects: when more complexity is needed

### Functional and object-oriented programming

Basically covering the tell-tale signs
of when functional programming may be a better choice,
and when object-oriented programming may be a better choice,
and what to do when the choice isn't crystal clear.
(In my biased opinion, stick with functional programming as much as possible.)
