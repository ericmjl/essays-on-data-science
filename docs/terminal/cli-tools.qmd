# Tools and Upgrades for your CLI

In this short essay,
I would like to introduce you
to a list of excellent command-line tools I have found on the internet.

Most of the tools listed here really do one thing: they add visual clarity to the text we are looking at.
This is mostly done by colorizing the terminal
with syntax highlighting.

Without further ado, let's get started listing them.

## `exa`

[`exa`](https://the.exa.website/) is a favourite of mine,
because it is an almost drop-in replacement for `ls`,
except with saner defaults.
It also comes with a saner set of defaults for the `tree` command.

After installing, you can replace `ls` and `tree` with `exa` by aliasing:

```bash
alias ls='exa --long --git -a --header --group'
alias tree='exa --tree --level=2 --long -a --header --git'
```

## `tmux`

[`tmux`](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) is another daily driver of mine.
I use it to keep remote terminal sessions persistent,
and use it effectively as a workspace manager between projects.

## `nanorc`

If you're like me and are accustomed to the `nano` text editor
rather than `vim` or `emacs`,
then [`nanorc`](https://github.com/scopatz/nanorc),
a set of syntax highlighting configurations
provided by [Anthony Scopatz](https://twitter.com/scopatz)
is an awesome addition to your `nano` toolkit.

(For what it's worth, I wrote this short essay in `nano`,
and `nanorc` played no small role in making the text readable!)

## `diff-so-fancy`

[`diff-so-fancy`](https://github.com/so-fancy/diff-so-fancy)
is a drop-in replacement for `diff`,
and makes it so much easier read diffs between two files.

After installation, you can easily replace `diff` with `diff-so-fancy` through aliasing:

```bash
alias diff="diff-so-fancy"
```

## `bat`

[`bat`](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) is another one of those instant favourites.
I use `cat` and `less` often to look through files,
but `bat` takes things to another level.
It is basically a mash-up between `cat` and `less`,
allowing you to scroll through your files in a `less`-like scrolling fashion,
while also providing syntax highlighting for the files you open.

At the same time, it'll let you concatenate two files together (just like `cat`)
and display them to the screen.

After installing, you can replace `cat` with `bat` by aliasing as well:

```bash
alias cat="bat"
```

## `fd`

[`fd`](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd)
is another tool that provides saner syntax than the default `find`.

After installing, you can replace `find` with `fd` by aliasing:

```bash
alias find="fd"
```

## `ripgrep`

[`ripgrep`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)
is a tool that will let you search directories recursively for a particular pattern.
This can help you quickly find text inside a file inside the file tree easily.
