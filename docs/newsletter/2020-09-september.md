# 2020-09 September

Hello fellow datanistas!

Welcome to the September edition
of the programming-oriented data science newsletter.
I hope you've all been staying safe amid the COVID-19 outbreak.

There's no special theme this month,
just a smattering of cool tools and articles
that I think will improve your productivity!

## [Setting up VSCode for Python Development like RStudio](https://stevenmortimer.com/setting-up-vs-code-for-python-development-like-rstudio/)

Firstly,
a blog post by Steven Mortimer on how to set up VSCode,
which is a really awesome IDE,
in such a way that it behaves like RStudio.
For R users who have to transition over to Python
(e.g. for work, or for personal interest),
this should help bridge the gap a bit!

## [Pylance in VSCode](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/announcing-pylance-fast-feature-rich-language-support-for-python-in-visual-studio-code/)

Speaking of VSCode,
I have been test-driving Pylance in my workflow at work,
and it's blazing fast and performant for code checking!
As I was writing my code,
the Pylance VSCode extension continually checked my code,
helping me to catch execution errors before I even executed the code.
Amazing stuff, Microsoft, I like what you've become now :).

## [ECDFs are in Seaborn!](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn/pull/2141#event-3453087212)

Since learning about ECDFs a few years ago,
I have advocated for visualizing distributions of data
[using ECDFs rather than histograms](http://ericmjl.com/blog/2018/7/14/ecdfs/).
Well, nothing beats having best practices available conveniently,
so I'm super happy to see ECDFs conveniently available in seaborn!

## [Stupid Simple Kubernetes](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/stupid-simple-kubernetes-e509355fba3d)

From experience at work,
I can vouch for the idea
that it's completely worthwhile for a data scientist
to learn the ideas around containers,
Kubernetes included.
To help get up to speed,
my colleague Zach Barry found an awesome article to help,
titled "[Stupid Simple Kubernetes](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/stupid-simple-kubernetes-e509355fba3d)".
Lots of terms in the K8 world get clarified in that article.
I hope you enjoy it!

## [Learn in Public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/)

This is an article that resonated deeply with me.
Learning in public has been, for me,
the biggest career hack that I have experienced.
Now, Shawn Wang has articulated clearly the benefits of doing so!
The biggest is being able to build a public-facing portfolio
that you can point to that demonstrates your skill set.

## From my collection

Some things I recently wrote about:

- [Software skills are important, for it helps us data scientists think _clearly_.](https://ericmjl.github.io/blog/2020/8/21/software-engineering-as-a-research-practice/)
- [Some early thoughts test-driving `pandera` for data validation.](https://ericmjl.github.io/blog/2020/8/30/pandera-data-validation-and-statistics/)
- [`.also()`, which comes from the Kotlin programming language, proposed in `pyjanitor` as a new feature](https://github.com/ericmjl/pyjanitor/issues/731) - I'm excited to see where this one goes!
- I'll be speaking at JupyterCon 2020 this year!
  Super excited to release a talk on how we compiled Network Analysis Made Simple
  into our [eBook](http://leanpub.com/nams) and [website](https://ericmjl.github.io/Network-Analysis-Made-Simple/)!

## A plug for an awesome open source contributor

The final thing I'd like to include in this newsletter
is a completely unsolicited but heartfelt advertisement for
[Samuel Oranyeli](https://samukweku.github.io/data-wrangling-blog/).
He's been a consistent contributor to the `pyjanitor` project,
and I have witnessed his skills growth
over the past few months of contribution.
The most important quality he possesses is consistent learning!
If you're hiring for a Python developer in the Sydney,
Australia area or remotely,
do consider him on your list!
