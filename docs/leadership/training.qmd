# Training and Developing Data Scientists

In _The Care and Feeding of Data Scientists_,
the authors cite [a survey by Burtch Works][survey] that found that
41% of data scientists surveyed cited
challenging work and learning opportunities as factors that motivate them.

To this end,
the technical skills that I have strived to equip my teammates with
include the following:

- building probabilistic estimation models that follow a lab experiment's design,
- building custom deep learning model architectures,
- digging through someone else's code and modifying it,
- writing code that is easy to read and maintain,
- writing documentation that gives the next person enough information to take productive action, and
- writing tests that verify the correctness of their code.

That list is a vast set of skills to learn.
It's not easy to pick up everything within a year;
indeed, I don't expect my teammates to have mastered all of these skills
within a year of joining the team.
Instead, this is a very long-term list of skills to develop;
I don't tend to think short-term when it comes to training.

How have we gone about this kind of training?
In 2022, I've done a few things, including:

- running quarterly docathons where we write documentation for our code,
- hosting workshops where we walk through the fundamentals of deep learning,
- intentionally holding off on making quick pull requests for minor code fixes and giving chances to teammates instead,
- scouting out projects for my teammates where probabilistic modeling is needed, and
- doing model reviews where we walk through the code-based implementation of a model.

## Onboarding Syllabus

I've also created an onboarding syllabus for new teammates.
When a new teammate joins the team,
I have them go through a personalized onboarding syllabus
that I tailor to their role on the team.
In my estimation, the new teammate should be able to complete the syllabus
within one month of joining.
Examples of activities in the syllabus include:

1. Making a pull request to a repository with improvements to an existing codebase.
2. Deploying an external machine learning model to our production environment.
3. Writing a test for a piece of code.
4. Meeting with suggested individuals.

Though I had the syllabus in place,
I didn't do as good a job as I wanted to follow through on the syllabus.
During our subsequent 1:1 check-ins,
I probably could have scaffolded the check-ins
by following up on their progress in completing the onboarding syllabus tasks.

## First Project

When a new teammate joined, I also had to think carefully about their first project.
While a first project rarely makes or breaks a career,
I see it as an excellent opportunity for a new teammate
to score early wins,
become trained in the tech stack,
and get to know collaborators better.
It also gives me a first touch point to observe
how our new teammate is adjusting to the new environment
and where I need to do any course corrections.

## Ways to improve

While I think these are great introductory ways of training,
I also think we might be able to do more for systematic training.
For example, once we know enough people have the desire to learn a skill,
we could organize a multi-day workshop teaching that skill
that also focuses on the application of that skill to a real problem.

At the same time, I could have done a better job
getting us to understand wet lab scientists' needs better.
One way I think we can do this
is to have days to shadow our wet lab collaborators.
That way, we can better understand what they need
and how our team can deliver what they need to advance their research efforts.
