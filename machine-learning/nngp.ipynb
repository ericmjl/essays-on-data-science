    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this deep dive into infinite-width neural networks tells me that\n",
    "we deep learners have a superb tool at our disposal\n",
    "for modelling complex relationships\n",
    "that don't have an obvious input-output structure.\n",
    "We can write a single layer neural network,\n",
    "expand it out to its infinite width form easily\n",
    "to get a Neural Net Gaussian Process kernel that,\n",
    "when conditioned on training data,\n",
    "could give us good test performance.\n",
    "(No guarantees though, we'd have to benchmark.)\n",
    "For expensive data collection problems\n",
    "like those that we find in the life sciences,\n",
    "this is a superb modelling tool on many levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, Gaussian processes are highly flexible and inherently Bayesian modelling tools,\n",
    "but proper kernel design is difficult;\n",
    "neural net design is an easier alternative language to work with\n",
    "to generate GPs for our modelling problems.\n",
    "Infinitely wide neural networks give us the best of both worlds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, because we get a highly flexible function learner,\n",
    "complex functions are easily modelled\n",
    "without needing to do much work with hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "Down with the Sisyphean tasks of twiddling with neural networks!\n",
    "(OK, maybe I'm taking the rant a bit too far.)\n",
    "Single layer infinitely wide neural networks did a practically great job on solubility\n",
    "with standard molecular descriptors,\n",
    "were as easy to wield as the cheminformatics-favourite Random Forest model,\n",
    "and had performance metrics effectively on par with Random Forests.\n",
    "We may be able to squeeze out more performance by adopting alternative model architectures\n",
    "that have different inductive biases, such as graph neural networks,\n",
    "but I have to admit, it was pretty easy to get to the performance levels we observed here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thirdly, because NNGPs are inherently Bayesian,\n",
    "the suite of tools from Bayesian decision science are at our disposal.\n",
    "Prioritizing, ranking, selecting...\n",
    "once you have the posterior likelihood density at hand,\n",
    "you have the principle by which these activities can be done.\n",
    "No more premature thresholds;\n",
    "delay all binarization until the end,\n",
    "when we have the posterior likelihood calculated.\n",
    "No fancy methods needed either;\n",
    "\"likelihood is all you need\"."

    "## Lessons Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "From this exercise, it seems evident to me that\n",
    "the nonlinearity is the biggest thing that affects the kernel,\n",
    "which in turn affects the expected performance\n",
    "(as given by the posterior means)\n",
    "and uncertainty calibration\n",
    "(as measured by the posterior standard deviations).\n",
    "If you remember where my headspace was when we first started,\n",
    "I was completely wrong w.r.t. this point;\n",
    "the NNGP kernel is highly influenced by the choice of activation function.\n",
    "Where I was correct was that the number of hidden nodes per layer\n",
    "didn't matter one bit for the performance of the network,\n",
    "because we are, after all, going to infinity ~~and beyond~~.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing that we can get pretty decent expected predictive performance\n",
    "_and_ somewhat nicely calibrated uncertainties\n",
    "without needing to fiddle with layer width, number of layers,\n",
    "number of training epochs, learning rate,\n",
    "and the myriad of other hyperparameters that we might be interested in...\n",
    "is actually kind of a nice result.\n",
    "With the NNGP kernel, we basically eliminate a ton of hyperparameters in training neural nets,\n",
    "and can focus primarily on the non-linear activation function\n",
    "to design the best NNGP kernel.\n",
    "Hyperparameter tuning is _the worst_ Sisyphean task\n",
    "that will bore the crap out of any data scientist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, from the perspective of _workflow_,\n",
    "using infinitely-wide neural networks is an attractive proposition\n",
    "for modelling problems that do not have\n",
    "an obvious input-output relationship.\n",
    "At the end of the day, by using infinitely wide neural networks,\n",
    "fitting a Gaussian Process with a particular kernel to the problem at hand,\n",
    "and this cuts down on the number of hyperparameters that we have to fiddle with.\n",
    "Pragmatically, I have a hunch that we can mostly stick with single layer NNGPs\n",
    "and leverage the uncertainty instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I have to comment on the lack of compute intensity needed \n",
    "to wield infinitely wide neural networks.\n",
    "Everything I did in this notebook was first prototyped on an M1 MacBook Air,\n",
    "done in emulation mode.\n",
    "No GPUs were used. None!\n",
    "The entire notebook runs from top to bottom in under two minutes.\n",
    "Take that, Transformers."
